# Movie App

I developed a movie application with React. You can search for movies in the application, you can learn about the movie. You can watch preview trailers, behind-the-scenes, etc. videos of the movie. You can register to the application and create a favorites list. You can keep the movies you want to watch later in this list. I plan to add features such as performance enhancement and commenting on the movie in the future.

## What's in the project?

+ Developed with ***React***
+ Used ***Firebase*** for data
+ Used ***SCSS*** for styled
+ Work with API [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
